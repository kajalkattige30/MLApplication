Recommendation using Apriori Alogrithm

The website is an Ecommerce website for clothing. Transaction History is collected and stored in the database.This collection of transactions is used as a learning dataset for the recommendation system. The system is trained over the dataset to generate some rules for recommendation. Now, when a clothing item is selected to view on the website, the web server sends the information of selected item to the recommendation system.The system then generates the recommended looks for the selected item and sends it back to the web server. The web server then displays these recommended looks on the website.

When a transaction is done,i.e, items are bought on the website, the details of the transactions are stored in the database and is further used as a learning dataset item for the recommendation system.
